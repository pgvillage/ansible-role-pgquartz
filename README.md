PgQuartz
=========

PgQuartz is a tool to define and execute PostgreSQL jobs.
One of the fine things is that jobs can have multiple steps, each step can be a shell script or a PostgreSQL query, 
each step can be run multiple parallel executions (github matrix style), and that whole definition can be managed with git.
This role installs pgquartz and runs pgquartz jobs with cron.
This role is part of PgVillage, which is an opinated PostgreSQL deployment for Virtual Machines.
